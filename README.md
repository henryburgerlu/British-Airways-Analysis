British Airways Data Science Project (Forage)

This repository contains two data science projects I completed as part of the **British Airways Virtual Experience Program**.
Forage Website: https://www.theforage.com/

These projects simulate real-world scenarios and offer hands-on experience with data analysis, machine learning, and deriving actionable business insights.
This project analyzed 50,000 customer booking records to understand what drives booking completion on the British Airways platform. The purpose of this project is to supports sales on focusing their apporach to come up with appealing
promotions and understand customer booking behaviors. 

## ‚úàÔ∏è Project 1: Web Scraping Customer Review Analysis

- **Overview**:  
  In this project, I scraped customer reviews and applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to uncover key themes in feedback.
  
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Web scraping
  - Topic modeling (LDA)
  - Frequency analysis
  - Visualization using matplotlib and pandas

- **Goal**:  
  Identify recurring issues and positive highlights from customer reviews to support service improvement efforts.

**Business Recommendations**:
  Based on the findings,specific actions for enhancing customer experience‚Äîsuch as improving check-in processes and addressing frequent complaints about delays is provided.

## üèñÔ∏è Project 2: Holiday Booking Completion Analysis

- **Overview**:  
  This project focused on analyzing factors that influence whether a holiday booking is completed, using a structured dataset provided by Forage.
  
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Data cleaning and encoding
  - Random Forest classification
  - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
  - Model evaluation using AUC-ROC and accuracy

- **Goal**:  
  Build a predictive model and uncover which customer and booking attributes most impact booking outcomes.
  
**Business Recommendations**:  
  Data-driven suggestions is provided in the file to optimize booking completion rates‚Äîsuch as targeting certain customer segments and adjusting timing strategies based on 'purchase_lead' and      other features.

Tools
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
